These are exciting times we're living in - AGI is around the corner, with massive implications for the area that I work in, data engineering, among others. 

I expect the way we developers interact with our computers will become multi-modal as these AI models mature. Apple dipping their toes in VR with the Apple Vision Pro is another thread in what may become this majestic tapestry (the happy path). Not only will these things change the way life is lived, but I think they also raise fundamental questions about human existence, consciousness and purpose that are beyond the remit of Science and that only Philosophy can answer. 

As technology and philosophy are two of my loves, there's no better time to start writing again than now. Welcome to my blog.
