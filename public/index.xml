      <description>Most marketers are familiar with Customer Segmentation. Imagine you ran an online retailer. You have thousands of customers, about whom there are a few details you know, such as the country they&amp;rsquo;re from, or the device they used to browse or purchase items from your store, or what their most commonly purchased item categories are etc. Imagine that you now want to send a promotion out, you now have a few choices.</description>

      <description>The standard pitch when we talk about Data Lakehouses is the fact that there are three distinct personas that need to access data.&#xA;Analyst - Structured data - Data Warehouse Data Engineer - Semistructured data - Data Lake ML Engineer - Multimodal data - Data Lake Things to think about&#xA;Open format of the data Compatibility with multiple engines Independent Security and Governance outside of the Engine Metadata Management Data Sharing Things that are nice to have</description>

      <title>When does a reranking step with RAG make sense?</title>

      <description>I was talking to a colleague about a RAG system he&amp;rsquo;s evaluating and he mentioned that the architecture includes a reranking model. This sent me down a bit of a rabbit hole about rerankers and why reranking models make sense within the RAG architecture.&#xA;A typical RAG workflow looks like this.&#xA;flowchart TD id1(Document Chunk) id2[[Embedding Model]] id3[( Vector DB )] id5(Query) id6[[Embedding Model]] llm[[LLM]] resp(LLM Response) id1--&gt;id2-- Stored in --&gt;id3 id5--&gt;id6-- Sent to --&gt;id3 subgraph sg1 [&#34;</description>

      <description>These are exciting times we&amp;rsquo;re living in - AGI is around the corner, with massive implications for the area that I work in, data engineering, among others.&#xA;I expect the way we developers interact with our computers will become multi-modal as these AI models mature. Apple dipping their toes in VR with the Apple Vision Pro is another thread in what may become this majestic tapestry (the happy path). Not only will these things change the way life is lived, but I think they also raise fundamental questions about human existence, consciousness and purpose that are beyond the remit of Science and that only Philosophy can answer.</description>
