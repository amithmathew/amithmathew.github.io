The standard pitch when we talk about Data Lakehouses is the fact that there are three distinct personas that need to access data.

1. Analyst - Structured data - Data Warehouse
2. Data Engineer - Semistructured data - Data Lake
3. ML Engineer - Multimodal data - Data Lake


Things to think about
- Open format of the data
- Compatibility with multiple engines
- Independent Security and Governance outside of the Engine
- Metadata Management
- Data Sharing

Things that are nice to have
- Object Tables
- ML through SQL
- 


Table formats have two layers
- Data Layer
- Data Management layer (time travel, schema evolution, transactional etc.)


I am probably going to anger a bunch of database engineers with how I'm going to explain the Lakehouse approach below - but in my defense, I can't think of a way of simplifying these concepts without losing information. If you can think of a better way
